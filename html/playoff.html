		<h3 id="header">#1 - Georgia Bulldogs</h3>
		<p id="teamDescrip"> The Bulldogs are No. 1, so all they need to do is keep winning. The more interesting angle is the SEC's hopes of having two teams in the playoff. With that, there isn't any margin for regular-season error. The league needs both UGA and Alabama to be undefeated when they meet in the SEC title game. For the conferences that could have one-loss champs, they need Auburn to win to make the case that the SEC shouldn't get two teams in. - ESPN.com</p>

		<div> <h3 id="header">#2 - Alabama Crimson Tide</h3>
		<p id="teamDescrip"> The Crimson Tide pretty much went through the motions against LSU, securing an easy victory that felt like the outcome was never really in doubt because the Tigers could not sustain drives with consistency. Alabama did have trouble running the ball, averaging only 3.2 yards per rush, but quarterback Jalen Hurts did enough to move the offense, throwing and passing for a touchdown in the Crimson Tide’s seventh straight win over LSU and 18th straight win at home. - si.com</p>

		<h3 id="header">#3 - Notre Dame Fighting Irish</h3>
		<p id="teamDescrip"> One thing is certain: Notre Dame is currently in the way of the Big Ten, Big 12 and Pac-12 front-runners, but the Irish are heading into their most difficult and arguably most important game remaining. Notre Dame hasn't played on the road since Oct. 7 at North Carolina. The Irish still have to play Navy (5-3) and Stanford (6-3), but with no conference title game to play in, this is the best opportunity to impress the selection committee one more time. - ESPN.com</p>
		<h4 id="stats">Key Stats</h4>
		<ul><b>Record</b> : 8 - 1</ul>
		<ul><b>Rushing Offense</b>: 5th</ul>
		<ul><b>Strength of Schedule</b>: 9th</ul>

		<h3 id="header">#4 - Clemson Tigers</h3>
		<p id="teamDescrip"> Clemson all but wrapped up the Atlantic Division by outlasting a gritty NC State team that has now lost two in a row. The Tigers also figure to stay put in this week’s playoff rankings after the three teams ahead of them all won. Clemson quarterback Kelly Bryant looked healthy running for 88 yards and throwing for 191 yards as the Tigers beat the Wolfpack for the sixth straight time. - si.com</p>
		<h4 id="stats">Key Stats</h4>
		<ul><b>Record</b> : 8 - 1</ul>
		<ul><b>Strength of Schedule</b>: 3rd</ul>
		<ul><b>Overall Defense</b>: 13th</ul>
